# cheer-me-up-cthulu
This was a Friday group project at Enspiral Dev Academy ðŸ”¥

The main idea is you sign in as your name, leave a compliment for someone else in the cohort who is in our database, and you receive a compliment back that someone has left for you.

We used Express, Express-Handlebars, Knex and Sqlite3

**How to use:**
