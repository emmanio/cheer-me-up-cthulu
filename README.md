This was a Friday group project at Enspiral Dev Academy 🔥

The main idea is you sign in as your name, leave a compliment for someone else in the cohort who is in our database, and you receive a compliment back that someone has left for you.

We used Express, Express-Handlebars, Knex and Sqlite3

Aiming to deploy this to Heroku in the next few weeks.

Stretch Goal:

When you receive a compliment you can send a ❤️ to the person that left it for you. When that person signs in they can see how many hearts they have.

Adding a random table of compliments that gets sent if you don't have any compliments in your table.
